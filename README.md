This project involves designing and implementing a database for an
 organ transplantation network using MySQL. The database will
 handle information about patients, donors, organs, hospitals, and
 transplant procedures. CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update,
 Delete) and triggers will be employed to manage and automate the
 database operations.
